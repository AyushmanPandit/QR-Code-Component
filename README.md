## My process

-   Reviewed the given preview and design images for desktop and mobile
-   Planned out my actions that were required to build the webpage
-   Wrote the semantic html for the webpage
-   Checked the given figma files and imported the required fonts and colors for the webpage
-   Using the figma designs, styled the elements one by one until satisfied, then moved on to the next
-   Finally, Compared the webpage to the original and made minute changes to make it look as similar to the original as possible

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Polished my HTML5 and CSS skills further with this project and learned how to write cleaner and more efficient code.

### Continued development

Now that I'm comfortable with basic CSS3, I wish to tackle projects involving heavy use of flexbox and grid to get better at it.
